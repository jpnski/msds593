MDS 593: EDA and Visualization

Lecture 1: (08/19/2020)

Intro:

The importance of context:
- before plotting or visualizing, what is the goal of the work, what are you attempting to accomplish

- exploratory analysis:
    - initial analysis to understand the data and what is interesting

- explanatory analysis:
    - final analysis, turning all of the data into information that can be consumed/interpreted

Identifying the audience:
- identify the decision maker - what do they care about?
    - dont make a presentation for multiple audiences, prepare separate and unique presentations

- what do you need your audience to know/do?
    - you are the subject matter expert
    - always want audience to act upon data, dont simply present data, make recommendations

- what type of data is available that will help to make my point?
    - dont ignore data that DOESNT support your point

Big idea (refer to online notes)

Data types:

- classify data types of your dataset, and determine what kinds of plots will represent trends in the data most effectively

- nominal (categorical):
    e.g.: banana vs apple vs cherry vs watermelon
        - all different but not comparable numerically

- ordinal (categorical):
    - e.g.: XS, S, M, L, XL
        - all different, but there is ordering and they can be compared
            - S < L

- quantitative (numerical):
    - interval (zero is arbitrary)
        - e.g.: dates, location, etc.
        - differences can be compared

    - ratio (fixed zero)
        - e.g.: dimensions, (x, y, z), etc.
        - zero indicates that there is none of the variable
        - counts and amounts
        - measurements

Operators:
    nominal: ==, !=
    ordinal: ==, !=, <, >
    interval:
    ratio:
 
- when plotting categorical variables:
    - if it is a ordinal variable, it should be plotted in its natural order
    - plotting a nominal variable does not require this and the order in the plot is arbitrary

Types of plots:

Scatterplots:
    - used for determining numerical relationships between two sets of numerical variables

Line chart:
    - used with paired numerical data (time series)
        - can demonstrate seasonality of a variable's value
    - avoid plotting a categorical variable on the X-axis
        - drawing a line between two points along an axis with a categorical variable suggests that there is some interpolation between the two discrete points
    - scaling is not very important as the plot isnt used for determining exact values but rather trends in the data as a whole

Area chart:
    - show a time series relationship, but also show volume
    - AUC is often emphasized with shading/color for legibility
    - most often compare 2+ categories

Bar chart:
    - categorical versus numerical variables being plotted
    - space between bars should be 1/2 bar width
    - order categories alphabetically, sequentially, or by value (if ordinal)

    - can be easier to parse than than a line chart/area chart if you represent a categorical variable on the X-axis
        - can view discrete segments of the data, and depending on the granularity you are interested in, can view which subdivisions show outliers/high delta values
            - e.g.: Years, with month granularity on the X-axis can be used to see months with high
delta values (compared to previous segment)
    - when plotting a nominal variable on the X axis in a bar chart, sort the values of the numerical variable from least to greatest or greatest to least, unless the categorical variable is ordinal

Box plot:
    - used to show distribution of a numerical variable
    - 1.5(IQR) factor determines which values are outside of the min-max range and are outliers
        Q1 - 1.5(IQR) = lower outliers
        Q3 + 1.5(IQR) = upper outliers
